Installation

To install as a macro, select the "Manage" tab, click on "Macros". Select the "Application" tab in the opening dialog, and press "Create Module". Give your new module a suitable name, chose "Python" as a language and press "Ok". The SharpDevelop IDE should open with a new project containing boilerplate code. Replace that with the contents of my file and press F8 to compile.

Now open the "Macros" dialog again, and your module will have sprouted three macros:

 * ExportTopoToObj
 * ExportTopoToRadiance
 * ExportToRadiance 

Select one of those and press "Run" (this only works if the current view is a 3D-view).
Configuration
Currently all relevant configuration happens in the code, near the top of the file. Configuration options are:

 * Metric or Imperial
 * Output file name (default: "revout.rad" on your desktop)
 * Output file name for topography as Radiance triangles (default:
   "revout_topo.rad" on your desktop)
 * Output file name for topography as Wavefront Object files
   (default: "revout_topomesh.rad" on your desktop; one or several numbered
   *.obj files with same base name)
